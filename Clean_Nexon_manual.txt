note indicates additional information that will assist you in gaining the optimum benefit and care for your vehicle.
warning indicates procedures or information that must be followed precisely in order to avoid the possibility of severe personal injury and serious damage to the vehicle.
safe driving safety consciousness not only ensures your safety and the safety of other road users, but it also helps to reduce the wear and tear on your vehicle.
safe driving depends on    how quickly you make decisions to avoid an accident.   your ability to concentrate.   how well you can see and judge objects.   how well familiar you are with your vehicle controls and its capabilities.
note fatigue is a result of physical or mental exertion that impairs judgment.
driver fatigue may be due to inadequate sleep, extended work hours, strenuous work or nonwork activities or combination of other factors.
safety tips   always take into account the road conditions, weather conditions, vehicle speed in order to prevent accidents.   turn   on  the side indicators at least 30 meters before taking a turn or changing the lane.   decelerate to a safe speed before taking turn.
do not apply brakes during cornering.   when overtaking other vehicles, watch out for the oncoming vehicle.   never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.   if your vehicle is equipped with infotainment/navigation system, set and make changes to your travel route only when the vehicle is parked.   program radio presets with the vehicle parked, and use your programmed safety 2 presets to make radio use quicker and simpler.
otherwise, water may enter the vehicle interior or the engine compartment.
if at all the situation demands that you have to drive through water then;   keep engine in higher rpm and crawl the vehicle in low gear.   flowing or rushing water creates strong forces.
driving through flowing water could cause the vehicle to about trying to drive through flowing water.   lightly apply the brake pedal to dry the liners until the brakes work normally once you are out of water.
warning do not attempt to start the engine if vehicle gets flooded due to water.
contact a nearest tata motors authorised service centre driving on a rainy day   check wiper blades, lights and brakes for proper functioning and condition.   check the tyre treads depth, the condition of the tread and tyre.   avoid harsh braking and sharp turns.
it may cause loss of control and lead to a skid.   for slowing down, shift to lower gears and brake gently.   keep lights   on  if visibility is poor.
driving on wet roads on wet road or during light showers,  aquaplaning  can occur.  aquaplaning  is the loss of direct contact between the road surface and the vehicle s tires due to a water film forming between them.
steering or braking the vehicle can be very difficult, and loss of control can occur.
the best advice is to slow down when the road is wet.
note if you have driven for a long time in heavy rain without braking, there may be a delayed reaction from the brakes when braking for the first time.
safety 3 night driving   ensure that all lights are working and windshield, window glasses are clean.   drive more slowly at night than in the daytime, as the visual range is restricted at night.
maintain a speed such that you can stop within illuminated distance of head lamps.   do not use the high beam unless inevitable.
it may dazzle the driver of the oncoming vehicle, thus causing an accident.   use head lamp main/dip beam to alert other road users on turns/ cross roads etc.   use side indicators for lane change or turning.
driving on gradients when climbing gradient, the vehicle may begin to slow down and show a lack of power.
if this happens, shift to a lower gear and apply power smoothly so that there is no loss of traction.
when driving down a hill, the engine braking should be used by shifting into a lower gear.
do not drive in neutral gear or switch off the engine.
warning on long and steep gradients you must reduce the load on the brakes by shifting early to a lower gear.
this allows you to take advantage of the engine braking effect and helps avoid overheating of service brakes resulting in reduced braking efficiency.
maintain a sufficient distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.
for long distance driving, perform safety checks before starting a trip and take rest at certain intervals to prevent fatigue.
seat belts this section of user manual describes your vehicle seat belt, airbag and child restraints system.
please read and follow all these instructions carefully to minimise risk of severe injury or death.   seat belts are the primary restraints system in the vehicle.
all occupants, including the driver, should always wear their seat belts to minimize the risk of injury.   sit back and adjust the front seat.

if your vehicle is equipped with a front passenger air bag (pab) and do not have pab deactivation switch, do not install a rear-facing crs in the front passenger seat.
if the pab inflates, a child in a rear facing crs could be seriously injured or killed.
if you install a crs in the rear seat, slide the front seat far enough forward so that the child s feet do not touch the front seatback.
this will help avoid injury to the child in the event of a collision.
safety 6 note children could be endangered in a collision if their crs are not properly secured in the vehicle.
be sure to secure the child in the restraint system according to the manufacturer s instructions. 7 note do not install a booster seat or a booster cushion with only the lap warning ther strap of the seat belt.

if the airbag srs warning indicator in the instrument cluster illuminates continuously, it means that remove the crs from front passenger seat and contact your tata motors authorised service center.
supplementary restraint system (srs) (air bags) (if equipped) the airbag  srs  system comprises of the following components depending upon the provided safety features in vehicle.   seat belt pre-tensioners   seat belt with load limiters   driver airbag   front passenger airbag   knee air bag   side airbags   curtain air bag   airbag  srs  ecu (electronic control unit)   collision sensors   srs wiring harness   srs warning lamp   front passenger airbag (pab) deactivation switch the system is active when ignition switch is in the   on  position or the ignition mode is   on.
in the event of a collision, the collision sensors 13 will detect signals, and if the airbag ecu judges that the signals represent a severe collision, will trigger the airbags.
the air bag inflates and deflates so quickly that you may not even realize that it has activated.
the air bag will neither hinder safety your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle.
airbag inflation is virtually instantaneous and occurs with considerable force, accompanied by loud noise and smoke, which is normal.
the inflated airbag, together with seat belts, limit the movement of an occupant, thereby reducing the risk of injury.
the particles are a normal by-product of the process that generates the non-toxic gas used for airbag inflation.
these airborne particles may irritate the skin, eyes, nose, or throat.
if you have skin or eye irritation, rinse the area with water.
also sometimes the smoke can safety 14 cause breathing problems , in such cases get fresh air promptly.
after inflation, airbag provides a gradual cushioning effect for the occupant thereafter deflates.
it is not advisable to drive your vehicle after the airbags have been deployed.
if you are involved in another collision, the airbags will not be in place to protect you.
the driver airbag is mounted in the centre of the steering wheel.
the front passenger airbag is located inside the dashboard in front of the passenger seat.
the vehicle fitted with the airbags have suitable indications on steering wheel and on dash board.
do not touch the air bag storage area s internal components immediately after an air bag has inflated.
the parts that come into contact with an inflating air bag may be very hot.
always wash exposed skin areas thoroughly with lukewarm water and mild soap.
note open your windows and doors as soon as possible after collision to reduce prolonged exposure to the smoke and powder released by the inflating air bag. 15 side airbags are mounted in front row seats for outboard occupants only.

deployment conditions (if safety airbags equipped) when front airbags (if equipped) should not deploy? minor frontal collision   seat belt offers adequate occupant protection in low severity collisions.
the modifications carried out, but not limited to the vehicle frame, bumpers, front fenders, ride height, suspension, seat belts, interior trims, steering wheel (especially holders), are not accep- table.
the airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags.
deployment of frontal airbags is not beneficial in low severity collisions.
side collision  during a side collision, occupants tend to move sideways.
therefore, deploying frontal airbags in such situations will not benefit the occupants.
side airbags, side curtain airbags (if equipped) are specifically designed to reduce the injuries that can occur in side collision.
rear collision  during a rear collision, occupants tend to move (rearwards) away from frontal airbags.
therefore, deploying frontal airbags in such situations will not benefit the occupant protection.
head restraints and seat belts provide occupant protection during a rear collision.
rollovers collision  during a rollover collision occupants may float inside the passenger compartment, if unbelted.
wearing seat belts provide highly effective occupant protection during rollover collision.
if your vehicle is equipped with a rollover sensor, both, seat belt and side curtain airbag can provide highly effective occupant protection during rollover collision.
front airbags, however, are not designed to deploy in a rollover as frontal airbags cannot offer any protection in rollover collision.
when front airbags (if equipped) deploy with minor or no visible vehicle damage? fitment of bull bars, seat covers on seats with airbags etc, is strictly prohibited, unless authorised by tata motors.
if you need to make any modifica- tions to accommodate any disability you may have, please contact your authorized tata motors dealer for necessary guidance.
this will lead to unexpected performance of system and may cause serious injury or death.
safety the airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags.
a severe collision to since the collision is underneath the vehicle, damage may not be readily visible.
when front airbags (if equipped) may not deploy, even with exterior visible vehicle damage? the airbags are triggered only when there is a collision severe enough to trigger the airbags.
the amount of visible vehicle damage is not always the correct indicator for airbag deployment.
some collisions can result in visible damage but no airbag deployment because the airbags would not have been needed or would not have provided protection even if they had deployed.
when a side airbag (if equipped) deploys with minor or no visible vehicle damage? the airbags are triggered only when child lock the vehicle underbody or suspension may cause airbags into a curb or other low fixed obje ct that causes a sudden deployment.
if the airbag system senses sudden deceleration, a strong collision to the side of the vehicle  s frame can cause a side airbag to deploy.
in such cases, there may be little when a side airbag (if equipped) may not deploy, even with exterior visible vehicle damage? it is possible that the side airbag does the provided with a child proof lock.

check tyre pressure and condition after every 15days including spare wheel. 167 starting and driving   avoid frequent start and stop as these increase fuel consumptions.   always make sure that the tyre pressures are correct.   do not carry any unnecessary weight.
regularly service your vehicle and adhere to the recommended service maintenance schedule.
personal driving style   do not depress the accelerator pedal when starting the engine.   do not warm up the engine when the vehicle is stationary.   always adapt your driving style to suit the prevailing road, weather conditions, and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
drive carefully.   avoid frequent, sudden acceleration and braking.   select appropriate gear according to varying speeds and load conditions.
note do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal while driving.   switch  off  the engine in stationary traffic or at signals.   keep an eye on the vehicle's fuel consumption.   driving safety systems are merely aids designed to assist driving.

recommended fuel economy speeds starting and driving 169 good driving practices   slow down before shifting to a lower gear.
this will help avoiding revving of the engine causing damage.   avoid frequent brake application which can cause overheating of brakes.   slower the vehicle speed while travelling in cross winds.
this gives much better control over the vehicle.   avoid high speed when cornering or turning.   depress the clutch fully while shifting gears.   make sure that vehicle is completely stationary before you attempt to shift in reverse gear.   drive slowly on wet roads.   you can get extra braking from the engine by shifting to a lower gear.
this can help you to maintain a safe speed and prevent your brakes from overheating specially while going down a hill.
tips for obtaining better fuel efficiency   always maintain the specified tyre pressure during fuel top-ups and also before a long trip.
vehicle running with low tyre pressure will consume more fuel than the one running with specified tyre pressure.   keep the vehicle clean.
get rid of the not in use luggage/stuff lying in the boot etc.   regularly inspect your vehicle for any leakages, worn out wires by rat bites etc.   always follow periodic & regular service schedule of the vehicle.   in places with high dust content (e.g.  gurgaon, jaisalmer etc.), do get the air filter cleaned every 5000 kms.   drive smart and smooth in an anticipatory manner.
select driving mode to suit your style.   do not accelerate excessively when you are in lower gears ( 1st or 2nd).
in lower gear, opening more throttle will shoot the engine rpm keeping the vehicle still at lower speeds starting and driving 204 which indirectly implies less distance with more fuel.   be in the maximum possible higher gear at a given speed.
this reduces the engine operating speeds which means the engine is running at lower rpm (revolutions per minute) for the same vehicle speed.
lesser the number of engine revolution lesser the fuel burned.   avoid harsh braking.   maintain healthy driving habits & while decelerating, do coasting in gear and not in neutral or with clutch pedal depressed.   consider using the car ac when you really require.
consider using lower blower speeds rather than higher for cooling as at higher blower speeds it consumes more electric power which is ultimately drawn from engine by burning fuel.   avoid unnecessary extra electrical loading on the car.   stop the engine wisely at traffic signals.
switch  off  the engine at the traffic signal only if the stoppage time is high (typically more than 30 sec).   while driving on highways, drive with windows closed.
the more you open the windows the higher will be the resistance to the vehicle at higher speeds which will reduce the fuel efficiency.   do not over speed; follow the speed limits.
more the speed, higher the external resistance on the vehicle which will finally result into unnecessary consumption of fuel.
running-in period the more you look after the engine when it is new, the more satisfied you will be with its performance in the future.

for engaging reverse gear, lift the latch and keeping latch lifted, shift to reverse never use the brake pedal as a footrest.
if you rest your foot on the brake pedal while driving, the braking system can overheat.
this increases the stopping distance and can even cause the braking system to fail.
starting and driving 190 n e v e r depress the brake pedal and the accelerator pedal at the same time.
if you have driven for a long time in heavy rain without braking, there may be a delayed reaction from the brakes when braking for the first time.
brake performance may become poor and unpredictable if brakes are wet.
after driving through water or washing the underside of the vehicle, test the brakes while driving at a slow speed to see if they have maintained their normal effectiveness.
if the brakes are less ef- fective than normal, dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while driving slowly until the brakes have regained their normal effectiveness. 145 braking on downhill gradients reduce the load on the brakes by shifting early to a lower gear.
this allows you to on long and steep gradients, you must warning do not shift to lower gear on a slippery road surface in an attempt to increase the engine's braking effect, the drive wheels could lose their grip.

climbing sharp gradients on loose surfaces start off smoothly in a suitable gear.
accelerate smoothly so that there is no loss of traction by over- revving of the engine.
choose as smooth a slope as possible and select the appropriate gear so that gear changing in the middle of the climb is not required.
changing gears in the middle of the climb can cause loss of momentum and engine stalling.
shifting to lower gear has to be done cautiously to avoid loss of traction.
under no conditions should the vehicle be moved diagonally across a hill.
the danger is in loss of traction and sideways slippage, possibly resulting in toppling over.
if unavoidable, choose as mild an angle as possible and keep the vehicle moving.
if the wheels start to slip within few feet of the end of the climb, motion can be maintained by swinging the steered wheels left and right, thereby providing increased grip.
if the vehicle stalls or losses headway while climbing a steep hill, make a quick shift to reverse and allow the vehicle to move back with the control of engine compression. 151 descending sharp gradients depending on the severity of the engine braking judiciously without gradient, shift into appropriate gear.
brake starting and driving application under such situations should be done very.

normal, dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while driving slowly until the brakes have regained their normal effectiveness.
braking on downhill gradients on long and steep gradients, you must reduce the load on the brakes by shifting early to a lower gear.
this allows you to take advantage of the engine braking effect and helps avoid overheating and excessive wear of the brakes.
if you rest your foot on the brake pedal while driving, the braking system can overheat.
this increases the stopping distance and can even cause the braking system to fail.
never depress the brake pedal and the accelerator pedal at the same time.
